Summary
----------

I became interested in frontend development in 2019, took the theoretical course 'Frontend developer' on Hexlet (https://hexlet.io/) and made 1 small project (https://github.com/rikkirikkardo44/frontend-project- lvl1).  
In July 2020, I entered the RS-school course "RSS React 2020 Q3". During the course I made 2 projects:
- small SPA quiz (https://github.com/rikkirikkardo44/songbird)
- team development of the course schedule page for integration into the site https://app.rs.school/. The development used technologies TypeScript, React, Redux and the Ant Design library (https://github.com/rikkirikkardo44/schedule).
I got acquainted with Angular and Angular Material, made one test SPA application on it (https://github.com/rikkirikkardo44/catsagram-test-task).  

After that, at the end of 2020, I finished the Node.js course and started learning React-native.
